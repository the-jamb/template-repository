# General tools

## Passwords

If we need to generate some random password or key, the [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/) service seems to be a great replacement!

It groups generated passwords by the possible usage type:

- Memorable, strong and very strong passwords
- WPA keys (regular 160-bit and 504-bit "monsters")
- WEP Keys (64-bit, 128-bit, 152-bit and 256-bit keys)
- CodeIgniter Encryption Keys (or for any other 256-bit key requirement)

It generates a set of 38 passwords at once. Each of them can be copied by simply clicking it.

## Screen share

If _Google Meet_ or _Microsoft Teams_ are not installed, we can [setup an quick 1-to-1 screen share session on-line](https://www.jitbit.com/screensharing/).

All that is needed is to:

- [Open JitBit's Free Screen Sharing tool's page](https://www.jitbit.com/screensharing/),
- Click _Share My Screen_ and
- Send someone the link

Some remarks:

- This is truly peer-to-peer, no-middle-server connection
- The generated link is valid and works for first two persons using it only
- Third or more person using the link will see an empty screen or will break meeting for everyone

For multi-user screen shares we need old good _Google Meet_ or _Microsoft Teams_.

# Developer tools

## Base64

[Base64.Guru](https://base64.guru/) rules!

- [Encode](https://base64.guru/converter/encode) Base64 from:

    - [Convert data URL](https://base64.guru/tools/data-url-to-image) to image (uri-image) to a file
    - [Normalize](https://base64.guru/tools/normalization) it, to safely sent it via email (MIME) or use as file name or as a part of URL (Base64URL)

Also quick guides on how to work on Base64 in: [Javascript](https://base64.guru/developers/javascript), [PHP](https://base64.guru/developers/php) or how to embed [data-uri](https://base64.guru/developers/data-uri) into a [HTML document](https://base64.guru/developers/html).

## JavaScript

* [ValidateJavaScript](https://validatejavascript.com/): as name says, good and challenging JavaScript linter
* [JSCompress](https://jscompress.com/): strong JavaScript compressor (works on in-line code or uploaded files)

## JSON

- JSONCompare:
    - [One file or doc](https://jsoncompare.com/#!/simple/): beautify, minify, sort, save (for sharing) and lint
    - [Two files or docs](https://jsoncompare.com/#!/diff/): compare
- [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/):
    - Edit JSON files in fully WYSIWYG mode with a lot of useful tools
    - Whole JSON or selected part can be edited as: plain text, tree or table
    - Save JSON data to cloud (1 MB limit) or to file, send as URL, export to CSV where possible    
    - [For 3 USD per month](https://jsoneditoronline.org/pricing/) you get add-free and for 6 USD per month you can save private JSONs to the cloud
- [JSON Studio](https://jsonstudio.io/):
    - Is slow and has some bugs, but also has some fabulous features
    - Can minify and format (beautify) JSON with one click (_Others_ button)
    - Tracks history of your edits which can save your ass in some situations
    - Can render JSON as a [graphic tree](https://jsonstudio.io/view/json-crack-viewer) (click _Zoom+_ or _Zoom-_ if nothing seems rendered)
    - Can render JSON as [an expandable table / grid](https://jsonstudio.io/view/json-grid-viewer) (for nested objects has a bug and shows only first column)
    - Can generate [a class diagram of DB structure](https://jsonstudio.io/view/json-db-viewer) (with relations!) to store your JSON in database
    - Can [convert](https://jsonstudio.io/convert/JSON-to-CSV-Converter) between JSON, YAML and CSV both ways (nested objects can't be exported to CSV)
    - Also can [compare two JSONs](https://jsonstudio.io/json-diff-checker) and look for possible differencies
- [JSON Viewer](https://jsonviewer.ai/) can only validate correctness of a JSON and beautify it

## Markdown

GitHub itself has a great Markdown support. But when writing large texts, it is often tiring to constatly swich between editor and preview.

In this case [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) can be a good replacement:

- Renders Markdown as you type
- Has reach Markdown editor; source colouring and formatting helps editing quicker
- Supports many keyboards (default are weird, but can be overwritten in settings)
- Supports workspaces and folders, allows to work over many files at all
- Can publish documents (as Markdown and HTML) to GitHub, Wordpress, Google Drive, Zendesk and more
- Able to synchronize workspaces accross devices and users using various sync services
- Can import and export Markdown or HTML; export to many formats [through Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html) is limited to paid users
- Has a handy document's table of contents and Markdown cheatsheet
- Supports simple templates for exporting and publishing
- When rendering live, offers full support for MermaidJS diagrams [see below](#example)

This is especially important when editing wiki pages, which seems to be a secondary-citizen to GitHub and most valuable functions (that works in repos and issues) doesn't work here (like no support for keyboard shortcuts etc).

## Website optimization

- Scan your website for [unused CSS selectors](https://www.jitbit.com/unusedcss/) scanner to find all obsolete CSS selectors
- Scan your HTTPS-website [to find any non-HTTPS served images](https://www.jitbit.com/sslcheck/) that may trigger a "mixed content" warning
- This is a website crawler; it starts with provided URL, and then follows all found links recursively to scan all pages

## Screen capture

- **Off-line**: [Microsoft Snip & Sketch](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/snipping-tool/9MZ95KL8MR0L) for images and screen-casts
- Even easier screen-cast capturer, with mouse clicks etc. is [free LICPcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
- Both produces image files (_.gif_ animations) that can be very easily uploaded to any ticket, page etc.
- Must be installed (can't be used on-line) and can't capture sound along with video
- **On-line**: [JitBit's Screen Capture](https://www.jitbit.com/screencapture/) full on-line video capture tool
- Produces _.webm_ video files which can't be uploaded to many places (i.e. GitHub rejects them)
- Since this is a full video format, it can record screen capture _with sound_ captured from system microphone
- You can convert to _gif_ using [Cloud Convert](https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-gif), [Convertio](https://convertio.co/webm-gif/), or [Online Coverter](https://image.online-convert.com/convert/webm-to-gif), but this will drop recorded sound

# Diagrams

We can use [MermaidJS tool for JavaScript](https://mermaid.js.org/) across entire GitHub (in [issues](https://github.com/ninergames/test-renpy-engine/issues/23), [discussions](https://github.com/ninergames/test-renpy-engine/discussions/21) and [in text files](https://github.com/ninergames/test-renpy-engine)).

## Example

```mermaid
flowchart TD;111-->|CASH>10|25;25-->|SSS=1|151;25-->|SSS=0|222;222-->|RESULT=Won|174;222-->|RESULT=Lost|238;238-->151;174-->151; click 174 href "https://mermaid.live/edit"
```

The `174` item is clickable and points to → [https://mermaid.live/edit](https://mermaid.live/edit).

## Source code

Pure MermaidJS code needed to generate the above diagram is:

```
flowchart TD
    111 --> |CASH > 10| 25
    25 --> |SSS = 1| 151
    25 --> |SSS = 0| 222
    222 --> |RESULT = Won| 174
    222 --> |RESULT = Lost| 238    
    238 --> 151
    174 --> 151
    click 174 href "https://mermaid.live/edit
```

If you don't need clarify in reading, you may minify the above, by replacing new-lines with `;` and removing most spaces:

```
flowchart TD;111-->|CASH>10|25;25-->|SSS=1|151;25-->|SSS=0|222;222-->|RESULT=Won|174;222-->|RESULT=Lost|238;238-->151;174-->151; click 174 href "https://mermaid.live/edit"
```

Resulting in a nice one-liner. Which you can put anywhere you wish (issue, discussion, wiki):

    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD;111-->|CASH>10|25;25-->|SSS=1|151;25-->|SSS=0|222;222-->|RESULT=Won|174;222-->|RESULT=Lost|238;238-->151;174-->151; click 174 href "https://mermaid.live/edit"
    ```
## Tools

- At <https://mermaid.live/edit> there's an on-the-fly editor which render MermaidJS code as you type it
- Use [mermaid.ink Generator](https://mermaid.ink/) to "convert" (render) MermaidJS code it into an image and data-uri string.

## Kroki.io service

We can use this service for:

- All other diagram types that MermaidJS doesn't support
- All diagrams that for some reason we want to generate in other language than MermaidJS
- All diagrams that in some scenario we need to use as a static image instead of editable code

Some other diagrams (not available in MermaidJS) that are worth considering includes:

- [Syntax diagram in Pikchr](https://kroki.io/examples.html#syntax)
- [Container diagram in C4 PlantUML](https://kroki.io/examples.html#c4-container) (for drawing system architectures)
- [Component diagram in C4 PlantUML](https://kroki.io/examples.html#c4-component) (can be used for drawing nearly everything)
- [MindMap diagram in PlantUML](https://kroki.io/examples.html#mind-map) (looks better than the one generated in MermaidJS)

And many more. Kroki.io supports [20+ languages](https://kroki.io/#support) and for certain languages (but not for MermaidJS) it allows rendering diagrams in PDF or TXT formats or as base64-encoded streams.

# Releases

All the details are given in [Git Basics - Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) and [Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).

In short:

1. Make a tag:
    * For exiting commit:
        * List all commits: `git log --pretty=oneline`
        * Pick the one you wish to tag (first seven letters of the has are enough), i.e.: `32c274c`
        * Add a tag: `git tag -a 0.1 32c274c -m "First version before general refactor"`
    * For latest commit: `git tag -a 1.4 -m "My version 1.4"`
    * Please, **do not** use `v1.0` scheme;
        * A version is a version, no need to prepend number with `v`
        * Even if [GitHub claims](https://github.com/akademia-slaska/template-repository/releases/new) that this is a common practice to do so
    * Use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) (three numbers) whenever possible
2. Push tag(s) to GitHub: `git push --tags`
3. Create [a new release](https://github.com/akademia-slaska/template-repository/releases/new): pick a tag, add title and a description, add some binaries, set options
4. Publish a release or save it as a draft.

GitHub **always adds a source code** to release. We **must always treat** all our releases **purely as private**.

Note that `git push --tags` pushes tags **only**. If you have some unpushed commits in the same time, you should send them next, using regular `git push`.

Repeated title or possibly a summary of the description.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to _one_ → _two_ → _three_.
2. Click on _four_.
3. Scroll to _five_.
4. See _six_.

What should happen? What is actually happening?

If possible and required, add a screenshot (<kbd>PrtSc</kbd>) or a screencast (_LICEcap_, _ScreenToGif_).

Provide device, system and browser information only, if it matters (i.e. bug cannot be reproduced everywhere).
